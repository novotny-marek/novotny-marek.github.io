I'm a student of human geography at Science Faculty, Charles University in
Prague, Czechia. Apart from geography I'm an open-source, open-science
enthusiast. My interests are: spatial data science, urbanism, Python, Linux.

I'm part of [Urban Structure](https://uscuni.github.io) research team at
Charles University, where I mostly do Python programming and sometimes bit of
Linux server administration.

Outside of university I work at [CZ.NIC](https://nic.cz) at
[Turris](https://turris.cz) as a Tech support specialist. My work consists of
resolving tickets from our users, improving the documentation and a little bit
of everything, it's and open-source project :)
